Project Title: Ad Click Prediction Using Logistic Regression

Objective:
To predict whether a user will click on an online advertisement based on demographic and behavioral features.

Tools Used:
- Python 3.13
- pandas, numpy, scikit-learn

Dataset:
advertising.csv containing features like:
- Age
- Area Income
- Daily Time Spent on Site
- Daily Internet Usage
- Clicked on Ad (target variable)

Steps Taken:
1. Loaded the dataset using pandas
2. Selected relevant features and target
3. Split data into training and testing sets (70/30)
4. Trained a logistic regression model
5. Evaluated model performance using accuracy and classification metrics

Results:
- Accuracy: 93.67%
- Precision, Recall, F1-score: 0.94 across both classes

Conclusion:
The logistic regression model performs well in predicting ad clicks. It can be used to improve digital marketing strategies by targeting users more effectively.
